// 2. Customer Interaction
// As a customer:

// I should be able to select a date for which Iâ€™d like to book a room for myself
// Upon selecting a date, I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
// I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
// I should be able to select a room for booking
// In the event that no rooms are available for the date / roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the user and asking them to adjust their room search
// { "id": "5fwrgu4i7k55hl6sz", "userID": 9, "date": "2022/04/22", "roomNumber": 15 }
