// 2. Customer Interaction (this is the dom file)
// As a customer:

// I should be able to select a date for which I’d like to book a room for myself
// Upon selecting a date, I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
// I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
// I should be able to select a room for booking
// In the event that no rooms are available for the date / roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the user and asking them to adjust their room search
// Refer to the “Add new booking” section from the endpoints table above!
